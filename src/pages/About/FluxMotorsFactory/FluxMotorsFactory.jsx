          After conducting a comprehensive analysis, we engaged in extensive
          discussions regarding the selection of a headquarter for our U.S.
          base. With utmost care, we meticulously assessed more than 60
          potential locations spread across 13 states. Our close scrutiny was
          focused on the Flux Technologies U.S. Motors factory, until we
          ultimately made the decision to establish our roots in the vast
          expanse of the long-abandoned The Packard Automotive Plant located in
          Detroit, Michigan. This plant, reputedly the largest unused
          manufacturing facility worldwide, possesses remarkable advantages that
          set it apart. Its exceptional attributes include close proximity to
          vital utilities, a well-established transportation system, and
          unwavering support from both state and local governments. As a result,
          this U.S. based manufacturing plant will undoubtedly carve a
          distinctive niche for itself.
